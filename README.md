![Banner](https://github.com/teagracekind/teagracekind/blob/main/profile_banner.png)

I’m a **Data Analyst** with a **Bachelor’s degree in Psychology** 🎓, passionate about combining my understanding of how people  
think and act with data-driven analysis!

With a strong background in **Psychology**, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis, focusing on understanding the "why"  
behind trends, patterns, and behaviours 🧠. 

### My Interests:
- **Gaming** 🎮: Passionate about using data to enhance user experiences and gameplay.
- **Media** 🎥: Interested in understanding audience behaviour and trends to shape content.
- **Fashion** 👗: Keen to explore how data can influence design decisions and market strategies.

I am excited about using data to understand **consumer behaviour** 👥, **preferences** 💡, and **trends** 📈 within these creative  
fields.
